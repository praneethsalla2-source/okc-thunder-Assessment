# NBA Practice Performance Analysis System Design

## System Overview

I would architect a comprehensive practice performance analysis system that leverages computer vision, machine learning, and real-time data processing to transform multi-camera practice footage into actionable player insights.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies:
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV and TensorFlow/PyTorch for real-time video processing
- **Machine Learning**: Custom models for player tracking, ball tracking, and action recognition
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS/Azure for scalable video processing and storage
- **Real-time Processing**: Apache Kafka for event streaming and Redis for caching
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for unstructured video metadata
- **API Layer**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI for RESTful services
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js dashboard for coaches and analysts
- **Video Storage**: AWS S3/Azure Blob for raw footage and processed clips

### Specialized Tools:
- **Pose Estimation**: MediaPipe or OpenPose for player movement tracking
- **Object Detection**: YOLO for ball and equipment tracking
- **Video Analytics**: Custom algorithms for shot analysis, defensive positioning
- **Performance Metrics**: Custom scoring algorithms based on coaching criteria

## Data Collection Strategy

### Primary Data Points:

1. **Player Movement Metrics**
   - Speed, acceleration, and directional changes
   - Distance covered per drill/session
   - Time spent in different court zones
   - Jump height and landing mechanics

2. **Technical Performance**
   - Shot accuracy and form analysis
   - Ball handling efficiency
   - Passing accuracy and timing
   - Defensive positioning and reaction time

3. **Biometric Data**
   - Heart rate and exertion levels (via wearables)
   - Fatigue indicators
   - Recovery time between drills

4. **Contextual Data**
   - Drill type and difficulty
   - Player combinations and matchups
   - Environmental factors (temperature, court conditions)

### Data Collection Methods:

1. **Multi-Camera System**: 8-12 strategically placed cameras capturing different angles and court zones
2. **Computer Vision Processing**: Real-time player and ball tracking with pose estimation
3. **Wearable Devices**: Heart rate monitors and accelerometers on players
4. **Manual Annotation**: Coach feedback and drill categorization
5. **Environmental Sensors**: Court temperature, lighting, and surface conditions

## System Architecture

```
[Multi-Camera Array] → [Video Processing Pipeline] → [ML Models] → [Data Storage]
                                                        ↓
[Wearable Devices] → [IoT Gateway] → [Real-time Analytics] → [Dashboard]
                                                        ↓
[Manual Input] → [Annotation System] → [Insight Engine] → [Coaching Reports]
```

## Key Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Live practice feedback with <5 second latency
- **Historical Comparison**: Track improvement over time
- **Drill Optimization**: AI-powered drill recommendations
- **Injury Prevention**: Movement pattern analysis for risk assessment
- **Team Chemistry**: Interaction analysis between players

This system would provide coaches with unprecedented insights into player development while maintaining the natural flow of practice sessions.
